## Research Experience
**Randomness in Number Theory**

Supervisor: Prof. A J Hildebrand from UIUC
- Performed statistical analysis of continued fraction digits of pi with 30 billion digits using three methods, analyzed the statistical rules presented using Python modeling, investigated the randomness of pi, and wrote a paper
- Chi-square type tests: performed Chi-square type tests on different blocks by changing the number of digits (expanded to 100M, 1B, 30B) and the number of blocks (expanded to 100, 1000, 10000) to get the corresponding p-values, and found that p-values followed the uniform distribution through analysis using Q-Q plot 
- Single-digit statistics and z-scores test: focusing on occurrences of a single digit d in a sequence of CF digits, performed the z-score test on same parameters as the chi-square functions; applied the KS test to obtain a p-value corresponding to the fit to measure how close the actual list of z-scores was to a normal distribution
- Extreme value statistics test: obtained the experimental value by finding the quartiles of each block, obtained the theoretical value (simulated digits that had the Gauss-Kuzmin distribution) by coding in Python, and determined that the digits of pi behave like those of a random real number based on the fact that the difference between two values was slight
- Created a presentation using Latex and presented our research progress at the Illinois Geometry Lab
- Made a poster and presented it to receive feedback that could further our research at the Undergraduate Research Symposium
- Organized our research work and created a poster with my teammates for the MAA Undergraduate Student Poster Session
